**Project Overview: Event-Based Feature Tracking with DAVIS Sensors**

This research explores event-based feature tracking using DAVIS sensors, leveraging their high temporal resolution and low latency. It utilizes the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to convert event data into image frames at intervals, optimizing for real-time robotic applications. The study demonstrates DAVIS sensors' potential to enhance dynamic environment perception and lays groundwork for future robotics advancements.
